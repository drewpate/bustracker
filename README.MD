# Bus Tracker

Our challenge was to pull data from the MBTA to show live Bus Location data. The red and blue icons are pushed onto the locations of the buses to display incoming and outgoing buses. 

## How to run.

The best way to run this is to clone the repo and open the entire folder in VS Code. I recommend using the Live Server extension to run it in your browser. 
You must have the icon .png files in the same folder in order for them to show up on the page.

## Road Map

Future versions of this app will display live data in text fields to the left or right. There will also be more UI to be added which is currently TBD.
